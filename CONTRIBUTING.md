# Contributing to Findr

If you redistribute this browser extension — whether as your own extension, application, software, or bundled within another project — I ask that you respect these **three core principles**:

---

### 1. **NO TRACKER SCRIPTS**
Please do not include any analytics, fingerprinting, telemetry, ad tracking, or third-party scripts that collect user behavior.  
Findr is built with a strict privacy-first philosophy. If you fork, clone, or redistribute it, your version should not compromise user trust or inject surveillance tech of any kind.

---

### 2. **RESPECT END-USER PRIVACY**
Avoid storing or transmitting any personally identifiable information (PII).  
Do not log user activity, browsing history, or any form of usage data without full transparency and user opt-in. This extension is designed to be as **invisible and respectful** as possible — keep it that way. - This includes user registration.

---

### 3. **KEEP THE EXTENSION/SOFTWARE/APPLICATION FREE AND OPEN SOURCE**
Redistributions must remain **free to use** and licensed under a truly open-source license (GPL v3 or compatible).  
You are welcome to build on or improve this project — but you must also ensure others retain the same freedom to inspect, modify, and share your version.

Thank you for contributing to a more transparent and user-respecting web.  
❤️ — Nullex
